            Hello and Welcome. Today i am going to tell you something about Eslint, Emmet and about other Web-Dev friends.
        </p>
        <div>
            <center><h4>ESLINT - Pluggable Javascript Code Analysis Tool</h4></center>
            <p>
                Eslint is an open source static code analysis tool to check syntax, find problems, and enforce
                code style. Eslint was created by <a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/">Nicholas C. Zakas</a> in the year
                2013, it is used for identifying, analysing and reporting the glitches found in Javascript/ECMAscript to the developer.
                Eslint’s goal is to avoid bugs and make code more consistent. It is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions :
            </p>
                1) ESLint uses Espree for Javascript parsing, which is built on Acorn Architecture.<br>
                2) It uses Abstract Syntax Tree to analyze the code.<br>
                3) You can add your custom rules at runtime in Eslint like a plugin.<br>
            <p>
                Well I hope you are familiar with its installation and few of the many errors ( I would rather say
                best practices ) like adding a “default case” in switch-case statement, ensuring the variable is
                used within its scope, etc.. Helpful tip : “You should have npm installed in your package before installing eslint.”
                Also if you are using eslint in vscode you would find a .eslintrc.{js, yml, json} normally “json” file.
                And if you open it you would find something like :
                <pre>
                {
                    "rules": {
                        "semi": ["error", "always"],
                        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
                    }
                }
            </pre></p>
            <p>
                Here, the names “semi” and “quotes” are the rule names. The first value is a error level of the rule and can be one of values from :
                <pre>
                    “Off” or “0” : It means - turn the rule off
                    “Warn” or “1” : It means - turn the rule on as a warning
                    “Error” or “2” : It means - turn the rule on as an error

                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the list of available rules <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/">here</a>. Its latest stable version v-7.25.0 was released on 23rd April, 2021.
            </p>
            <center><h4>Emmet - A Text Editor Plugin.? or More.?</h4></center>
            <p>
                Basically what most text editors allow you is that you store and re-use commonly used code chunks 
                or commands - these chunks are called “code snippets”. Snippets are a good way to boost your productivity,
                but the problem is that you have to write it the first time to reuse them later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emmet takes this idea in a different way. Basically what emmet does is, it allows you to type a CSS-like
                expression that can be dynamically parsed and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation.
                It was designed to optimize the workflow of HTML/CSS developers, but now it can also be used with other languages
                like Javascript. When you install Vscode, emmet is automatically enabled for HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example => when you type html in Vscode, It would show you a pop-up displaying html5 on left and emmet on right side(on the same row). Just click on it and you will see the html-5 basic element code magically appearing on screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emmet was designed by Vadim Makeev in 2008 and it’s original name was Zen Coding. It has list of 100s of
                Shortcuts and you can download the Pdf list <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PTwZECIiW_Bbew7GxEuabIV3ujdw6Jwp/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Today you can find emmet extensions for React library of functions also.
                Today one of the most popular Emmet extension (Vscode editor) is ES7 React/Redux/React Native
                Snippets. It is available on VScode Marketplace.
